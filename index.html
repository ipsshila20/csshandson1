<div class="s1">
<ol>
    <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
    <li><span id="i1">CSS is not neccesary</span> <span id="i2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li>
    <li><span class="s2"> External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<div class="s3">
    <ul>
        <li> Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li> Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li> External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to style in the External CSS files, However, <span class="s7">in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.<span class="s5">
    </ul>
</div>
        <p class="s4"> When comparing CSS class vs Id,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also <br>  special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to and it's  used by JavaScript.  <br>
        <p class="s4"> In css, selectors are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a wen page. Once an elements has been tregered, a style or set of styles can be applied to the  <br> element.
        <p class="s4"> There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. <br>
